# how to ask a question?
***
1.   ## check if your question already exist
    - Have a link to solutions that haven't helped or how your question is diverse
 
2. ## Understand the code
    - Go through line by line and figure out what each line does.
    - Think about things that might be confusing (google them).

3. ## Clearly discribe the problem
    - Explain the exact steps you took to produce the problem.
    - Explain what you expect to see
    - Explain what you actually see.

4. ## Provide the code that illustrates the problem
    - When you share the code, make sure that the code doesn't change by the time someone looks at it.
        - This means you should create a separate copy of your code
          just for the question.
    - If you change the code by the time someone looks at it, your question is not just a bad question, it is inaccurate, which is worse than bad.
    - Do not punish people that want to help you.

5.  ## Make sure the code you're sharing can reproduce the problem
    - Take the code you shared, and make sure it behaves exactly like you described.
      If you share broken code that doesn’t replicate the problem, it will be impossible to help you.

6.  ## Format your code consistently
    - It doesn’t matter what style you use, just make sure that you’re consistent. This makes your code easier to read.
    It will also help you with the next step.

7.  ## Check yourself for typos
    - Nobody wants to look for your typos.
    - If you're stuck on a lesson in a tutorial, go back to a point where your code worked and redo the lessons from there, making sure that your code continues to work each step of the way.
    - If you’re on a specific lesson and the code is provided, check the provided code and see if it works.
      If the provided code works but yours doesn’t, then you have a typo.
    - It's your job to find that typo. Do not waste someone else's time for asking them to solve this.

8.  ## Explain what you did to troubleshoot the problem.
    - Come up with a list of hypotheses about what the problem might be and then test them methodically. For each hypothesis, explain what you did to test each hypothesis.
    - During this process you might figure out the problem yourself.

9.  ## Explain what you think the problem might be.
    - Based on your tests in the previous step, provide your best guess on what you think the problem might be.

10. ## Proofread your question.
    - Read through your question and make sure you’ve provided everything that someone would need to answer it.
    - Edit for clarity. If you think something might be confusing, fix it. If there’s a typo, fix it. If you have typos in your question, people will assume that you have typos in your code.

11. ## Send dupdates and remember- this will not be your last
     question
    - If you’ve figured out the answer before anyone can respond, then tell people so they don’t waste time looking for an answer you’ve already found.
    - When you get an answer back, take time to digest it carefully and fully understand what the person is saying.
      Keep in mind they might not actually be right.
      So you need to verify that their solution works.
    - Thank each person that helped you and remember that they didn’t have to answer your question, but for some reason they wanted to.

12. ## Create a clear and proper written title!
